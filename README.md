### TODO
- move location to select text underneath the component
- add example to demo with heavily styled/customized UI like Material UI
- possibly confusing: selecting partial DOM element text, but the `finder` library returns the selector for the entire text string
  - should this be revised to a devtools-style pick element to track interaction?
